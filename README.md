# Project 3: CSS Color Markers - Responsive Web Design (FreeCodeCamp)

##### This repository contains the completed code for Project 3 in the FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" course. 

This project demonstrates how to create a colorful design of markers using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The **CSS Color Markers** project showcases how to style elements using advanced CSS properties like gradients and shadows. The project features three colored markers (red, green, and blue) displayed on a webpage, with a focus on visual design using CSS.

### Key Features

- **HTML Structure**: The markers are structured using simple HTML elements (`<div>`) for the body and cap of each marker.
- **CSS Styling**: Each marker is styled using CSS with gradients and shadow effects to make them visually appealing.
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: The markers use CSS linear gradients to create realistic color transitions.
- **Box Shadows**: Shadows are applied to enhance the 3D appearance of the markers.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to center-align the markers and make them responsive across different devices.

## Code Details

### HTML Structure:

- **Container**: The markers are placed within a `<div>` container.
- **Markers**: Each marker consists of two parts: the cap and the sleeve, represented by nested `<div>` elements.
  
### CSS Details:

- **Text Alignment**: The title of the project (`<h1>`) is centered using `text-align: center`.
- **Container Styling**: The container has a white background and padding for proper spacing.
- **Marker Styling**: The markers have gradient backgrounds and shadows, making them appear three-dimensional.
- **Cap and Sleeve**: The cap and sleeve are styled with different widths and colors to simulate the look of real markers.
